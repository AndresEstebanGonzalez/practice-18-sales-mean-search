# practice-18-sales-mean-search
This project loads daily sales data from a CSV, calculates the mean, and uses binary search to check if that mean exists in the dataset. Includes error handling for non-integer means and missing values, plus tests with pytest. A practical exercise in algorithms + data analysis.
